# c-TDDD49P2PProject
This is a project from the TDDD49 course, where the task was to write a messenger application i C#. In the messenger you were supposed to be able to connect to a different ip address, send connection request, text messages, images and be able to store the conversation data on each end in a json string. A sample image is provided below and more screenshots are available in the root directory of this repo.
